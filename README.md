# Beat my Buddy 4 Peloton

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/378ad9de-8622-4e14-aa91-789ae3daa608/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/stoic-feynman-7ad45d/deploys)

The project was created because I would like to have a notification when my friend has broken my highscore. While searching I found the repository of @ostranme [https://github.com/ostranme/peloton-postman], who collected the info of the Peloton API. Thanks a lot for your preliminary work!
